OI, THIS IS MANDELBRO V1.2

Controls:
	Click display to recenter focus
	Arrow keys will shift focus one screen in that direction
	PgUp/PgDown zooms in and out
	Home and Eng change the Iteration Bound
	Pressing 1 and 2 will switch between the colour themes
	'x' will dump the display into a little png file
	'w' will initiate generation of a 1200x800 wallpaper. This process cannot be interupted.

To do for later versions:
	Some sort of control for just how much changes to zoom and bound are
	More colour themes, button for cycling colours
	Faster generation
	Drag a square on display to zoom and refocus all at once
	Mousewheel zooming?
	Mandelbro constantly plays "Wish You Were Here" while open, even if your speakers are off
